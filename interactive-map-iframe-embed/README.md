# Interactive Holiday Park Map: Embedded Map
This is the Embedded Map application for the Interactive Holiday Park Map Project. This application presents the Interactive Map to Holiday searchers and will be linked directly or embedded onto Holiday Parks' websites. It functions equally well on desktop and mobile devices.

This project provides the following functionality: 
1. Allows Holiday Park owners to embed their map on their websites easily or to 
link to customers directly.
2. Allows Holiday searchers to click on individual map markers to view more 
information about them.
3. Allows Holiday searchers to check availability for their chosen date. Markers 
linked with Pitched Booking will be highlighted if they are available.
